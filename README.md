🧠 Customer Segmentation Using Clustering
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to group customers into distinct segments based on purchasing behavior and demographic features. 
The segmentation results can be used to target marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

📌 Overview
Customer segmentation is a powerful marketing tool that helps businesses understand and serve their customers better. 
In this project, we use clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to divide customers into meaningful groups based on their attributes.
